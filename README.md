## Abstract
As more data available, it has become possible to data-driven new drug discovery pipeline. We, therefore, propose a model for predicting a similarity score between two drugs based on the differential gene expression patterns of the two drugs. Our model trains a Siamese neural network that takes fingerprints of a pair of two drugs and predicts its similarity score.
